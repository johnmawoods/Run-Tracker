# Run-Tracker

Final project for my mobile development class. This project was coded using storyboard, swift 5, and xcode. A user can check the weather to determine if it is a good day for a run. When a run is started, the user's route that they run will be shown in a mapView utilizing a polyline. During the run, a user can take a photo and save it to the run. The information of the run is updated in real time and I use core data to make the data persistent. Previous runs are sorted by date and can be viewed in a tableView.
